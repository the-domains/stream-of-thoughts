description: 'Walking the longest medieval road of Denmark. Earlier this year, in April, we visited the Kalø Slotsruin just outside the town of Rønde. It was a breezy, chilly but sunny late afternoon. The light painted the shores and the marshland surrounding the castle with golden colours. 700 years ago this was the stronghold of King Erik Menved.'
