> To befriend and love an elderly person, though richly rewarding, involves the clear notion of finitude. With contemporaries and friends, you hope for decades of companionship, a creel full of stories, and much in the fossil record to share. With a spouse is spun the spider web of years, with each new one a stronger skein until life without the other does not seem possible. To have children and that higher love entails clear evidence of your mortality as well as hope that the better part of you might endure. But an audience with living history cannot feature interviews and anecdotes without number.
